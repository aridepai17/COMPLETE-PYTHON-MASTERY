What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python is widely used for various applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation, and more.

Key Features of Python:

Simple and Readable Syntax:

Python's syntax is designed to be easy to read and write, making it an excellent choice for beginners.

Interpreted Language:

Python code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier and allows for quick experimentation.

Dynamically Typed:

In Python, you don't need to declare variable types explicitly. The type is inferred at runtime, providing more flexibility.

Large Standard Library:

Python comes with a rich standard library that supports a wide range of tasks, from file I/O to web services.

Cross-Platform:

Python is available on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
